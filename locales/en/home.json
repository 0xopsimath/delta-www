The Limited Staking Window allows participants to stake Ethereum and receive rLP tokens in return.  at the end of the Limited Staking Window (March 4th, 9:30AM PST).  The window will remain open for 10 days, rewarding early stakers with a bonus of up to 30%. Once the Limited Staking Window closed, participants can claim rLP tokens and stake them in the Deep Farming Vault to earn yield.
